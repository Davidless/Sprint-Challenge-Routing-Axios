##1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

### `Client-Side Routing`: the server is handled in the JavaScript via components. When the side loads it loads entirely and new requests only change the parts of the page where a new component is being rendered. This is generally faster once the initial page has loaded.

### `Server-Side Routing`: a new document is served to the user when they request to see a new page, effectively discarding the old page. This is great for only showing data is requested and nothing more. Though it could be slow to load a fresh page every time new data is requested.
